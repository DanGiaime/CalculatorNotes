Circuits
~EMF
~~E=dW/dq
~~Loop Rule
~~~The sum of changes in pot. in a complete loop = 0
~~Junction Rule
~~~Current in=current out
~~Resistance Rule
~~~Going direction of current-->drop of iR
~~EMF rule
~~~Going direction as EMF-->gain of E
~Galvanometer
~~To make an ammeter
~~~Connect a low resistance in parallel
~~To make a voltmeter
~~~Connect a large resistance in series
~Cap w/ one resistor
~~Step 1
~~~Loop Rule
~~Charging
~~~q(t)= CE(1-e^(-t/RC)
~~Discharing
~~~q(t)= q*e^(-t/RC)
